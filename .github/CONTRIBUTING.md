# Contributing

Contributions for Notion are more than welcome however there are a few guidelines that I ask you follow.

# Guidelines

1) Keep it to JavaScript/NodeJS, I don't mind external APIs and node modules being used but please do not use alternative languages
2) All code will be checked, I may change a couple of things around this will be mentioned in pull requests
3) Follow Discords terms of service, the bot is meant to be for fun. Lets keep it this way.
4) Do not implement anything for databases, the bot does not require one, any form of API tracking can be added. If you're using an API from RapidAPI then it will do the tracking for you.
5) Do not commit your config.json file, this file contains sensitive keys that can be exploited. If I see your config file in the commit then your pull request will be removed
6) All code is reviewed and tested before hand, this may take a while depending on your request so please be patient with me.
7) Bugs should be submitted under the issues tab. If you do not have a github account please tweet them at me https://twitter.com/RapidTheNerd
8) Remember the bot is for fun, avoid pissing people off.
9) Make sure to follow the licensing and any terms of service (Discord, RapidAPI etc)
